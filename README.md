# Description

**SIMPLE EMPLOYEE CRUD** project is a simple project that I created to perform simple data manipulation activities including **create**, **read**, **update**, and **delete** with data related to employees.

The purpose of creating this simple project is as a learning activity for me to broaden my insight in the field of web development. In the future, I will create several simple projects related to web development and also related to IoT development.

I also use the [DataTables](https://datatables.net/) library as a complete package provider of table features. For notifications, I use the [sweetalert2](https://sweetalert2.github.io/) library.
